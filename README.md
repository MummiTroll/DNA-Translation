# Translation

A bioinformatic app in Python 2.7 that enables translation of DNA into protein

Paste a DNA into the textbox, choose the ORF and the type of presentation, “DNA and Protein” or “Protein”.

Translate: translates the DNA and shows either the resulting protein or both DNA and protein.

Save in FASTA format: saves the result, DNA and protein or just protein as a txt file.
